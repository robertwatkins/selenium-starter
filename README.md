# selenium-starter
This is a sample test project to show Java / Selenium tests in action.

The target system is [Altoro Mutual](http://demo.testfire.net/), an online site used to test Software Security Scanners.

This has a couple benefits:
 * There is no expectation of causing issues with the site
 * This sample can be run from any system with access to the internet.

A couple notes on the toolchain:
 * Use Java 1.8+ (though 1.7 may work)
 * You will need maven installed (or have maven supported through your IDE)
 
 The Wiki will have notes on test cases and useful documentation about the site being tested.
